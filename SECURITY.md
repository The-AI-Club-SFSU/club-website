## ❗ Vulnerabilities

We currently use Dependabot and CodeQL in our repositories to monitor for new potential vulnerabilities in all commits/pushes. 

Of course, we also have to account for cases that may fly-by our first automated line of defense.

### 🔐 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know right away.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly resolve any and all problems.

To contact us, email us through our [organization page](https://github.com/The-AI-Club-SFSU).
